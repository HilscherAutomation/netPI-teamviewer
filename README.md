## TeamViewer

Made for Raspberry Pi 3B architecture based devices and compatibles

### Docker repository

https://hub.docker.com/r/hilschernetpi/netpi-teamviewer

### Container features

The image provided hereunder deploys a container with installed [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/) Host software to enable remote management of exactly this container over a TeamViewer Client.

Base of this image builds [debian](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/base-images/base-images/) and a [TeamViewer Host](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/linux/) daemon compiled for [Raspberry Pi](https://download.teamviewer.com/download/linux/teamviewer-host_armhf.deb)

Teamviewer Host daemon in general is able to grab frames (/dev/fb0) and keystrokes from the Linux system console (/dev/tty1) only. This is why the container invokes a login [session](https://linux.die.net/man/2/setsid) with the program [agetty](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/agetty.8.html) to generate a new system console you can access to via the TeamViewer client.

### Container hosts

The container has been successfully tested on the following hosts

* netPI, model RTE 3, product name NIOT-E-NPI3-51-EN-RE
* netPI, model CORE 3, product name NIOT-E-NPI3-EN

### netPI Docker restrictions

netPI devices specifically feature a restricted Docker protecting the Docker host system software's integrity by maximum. The restrictions are

* privileged mode is not automatically adding all host devices `/dev/` to a container
* volume bind mounts to rootfs is not supported
* the devices `/dev`,`/dev/mem`,`/dev/sd*`,`/dev/dm*`,`/dev/mapper`,`/dev/mmcblk*` cannot be added to a container

### TeamViewer End User License Agreement (EULA)

Before using TeamViewer you have to accept the [TeamViewer EULA](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/eula/).

Since in a container you cannot click on an "accept" button like you are use to on desktop systems such as Windows or Linux, you have to define an environment variable as container parameter instead to accept it.

To accept the TeamViewer EULA set a container environment variable `TEAMVIEWER_LICENSE` to the value `accept`. The subsequent TeamViewer daemon will be started with the option `license accept` then.

For a quick overview ... here is the Teamviewer Host daemon printout if called with the `license show` option:

### TeamViewer Password

A session between a TeamViewer Client and TeamViewer Host is protected by a password. The password is a parameter handed over to the TeamViewer Host daemon when it is started and is requested by the TeamViewer client before the connection is established.

To define the TeamViewer Daemon password set a ontainer environment variable `TEAMVIEWER_PASSWD` to your specific password e.g. `V>yC9b[J`. If there is no password environment variable defined, the container sets the default password to `12345678`.

### Container setup

#### Privileged mode

The privileged mode option needs to be activated to lift the standard Docker enforced container limitations. With this setting the container and the applications inside are the getting (almost) all capabilities as if running on the Host directly. 

netPI's secure reference software architecture prohibits root access to the Host system always. Even if priviledged mode is activated the intrinsic security of the Host Linux Kernel can not be compromised.

#### Host devices

To grant the program agetty access to the system console the `/dev/tty1` host device needs to be exposed to the container.

To grant the TeamViewer Daemon access to the system console framebuffer the `/dev/fb0` host device needs to be exposed to the container.

#### Environment Variables

Define an environment variable `TEAMVIEWER_LICENSE` with value `accept` to accept the TeamViewer EULA.

Define an environment variable `TEAMVIEWER_PASSWD` with value `YOUR PASSWORD` to define a secure password between TeamViewer Host and TeamViewer Client.

#### netPI example

STEP 1. Open netPI's website in your browser (https).

STEP 2. Click the Docker tile to open the [Portainer.io](http://portainer.io/) Docker management user interface.

STEP 3. Enter the following parameters under *Containers > + Add Container*

Parameter | Value | Remark
:---------|:------ |:------
*Image* | **hilschernetpi/netpi-teamviewer**
*Adv.con.set. > Env > +add env.var.* | *name* **TEAMVIEWER_LICENSE** -> *value* **accept** |
*Adv.con.set. > Env > +add env.var.* | *name* **TEAMVIEWER_PASSWD** -> *value* **YOUR PASSWORD** |
*Adv.con.set. > Restart policy* | **always**
*Adv.con.set. > Devices > +add device* | *Host path* **/dev/tty1** -> *Container path* **/dev/tty1** |
*Adv.con.set. > Devices > +add device* | *Host path* **/dev/fb0** -> *Container path* **/dev/fb0** | 
*Adv.con.set. > Privileged mode* | **On** |

STEP 4. Press the button *Actions > Start/Deploy container*

Pulling the image may take a while (5-10mins). Sometimes it may take too long and a time out is indicated. In this case repeat STEP 4.

### Container access

The container starts the TeamViewer Host daemon in accordance your environment variable settings. 

Based on the physical hardware parameters found (CPU serial number, MAC ID) the deamon will generate a unique TeamViewer ID and tries to log on to the TeamViewer server over the Internet using this ID.

Finally it prints the Teamviewer ID to the containers log file. 

To retreive the ID you can have a look at this log file via netPI's Docker management web GUI if you click the small icon `logs` in the overiew list of the running containers.
